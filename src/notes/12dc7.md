Alright so next step is going to probably be me working out all the fiddly bits for presentation and such, making sure that everything is showing up the way I want it to. I'll also need to create a post template for my likes, bookmarks, and reposts. Should I have that in the same category as my notes? Make that a sort of "timeline" feed? Something to consider.
