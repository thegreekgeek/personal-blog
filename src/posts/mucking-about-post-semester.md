Alright, so I've been through a whirlwind of a school year. Thankfully I don't have a summer semester to slog through, so I've unexpectedly found myself with a bit more free time on my hands than I've had in a bit.

In an attempt to stave off boredom, I've decided to take a further step into establishing my web presence by actually working on my personal website. The eventual plan is to manage it on my [silverbullet](https://silverbullet.md) instance using the git plug and to publish it via github actions.
