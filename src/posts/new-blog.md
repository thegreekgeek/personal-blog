Hey all! So after failing to grok hugo I switched my blog backend to 11ty. It's going loads better already and hopefully this'll mesh well with my JS class.

The fact that nunjucks is pretty similar to Jinja2 is a huge boon, as I've been mucking about with Jinja for a bit as a result of my Home Assistant adventures. Obsidian to a lesser extent, through playing with templater.
